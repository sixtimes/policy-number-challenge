# Policy OCR
This is my solution to the Kin Policy Number Challenge.

## Ruby Version
This project requires Ruby 3.4.3 and was bundled with Bundler 2.6.8. Run `bundle install` to get started!

## Running the project
`ruby ocr.rb path/to/textfile.txt [--output path/to/output.txt]`

`--output` will write to a specified file in the format requested.
